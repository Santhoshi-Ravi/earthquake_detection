# Earthquake Detection using Machine Learning models
This repository contains the code used for Morroco Solidatary hackathon to try to predict earthquake detection. This uses INSTANCE dataset for the same purpose.
Early-warning alerts are essential for earthquake mitigation. Having a solid early warning system can save lives, reduce injuries, and better coordinate emergency response organizations. Currently, early-warning alerts are sent around three to four seconds after an earthquake starts [1]. In this project, we aim to use machine learning to predict the occurrence of earthquakes using waveform traces and improve the early warning system by sending the warning before its occurrence. We chose a 10-second window as our training samples only consist of 120-second waveforms. In future work, we will want to use time series data of a much longer duration and predict the occurrence of an earthquake at an even earlier stage.

## Dataset Used
[INSTANCE â€“ the Italian seismic dataset for machine learning](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/13/5509/2021/)
